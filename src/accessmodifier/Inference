Public variables can be accessed within class and can also be accessed anywhere when we create object for that particular class.
Protected variables can be accessed within the same package and also can be accessed inside different package if it is subclassed.
Private variables can be accessed within same class only.To use private variables of one class into another class we can access through getter and setter methods.
